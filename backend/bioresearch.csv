We are specifically interested in how different phytoplankton groups respond to environmental perturbations such as changes in CO2, light intensity and nutrient availability. My students and I aim to not only characterize the responses of phytoplankton to a multitude of environmental factors, but also to understand the underlying processes of the measured responses, such as photosynthetic pathways, carbon acquisition processes and protein regulation. In collaboration with my colleagues at FSU, within the US and around the globe, we investigate these ecophysiological responses on different levels (from gene expression to ecosystem function) and in many ecosystems (Gulf of Mexico, tropical oligotrophic regions, Southern Ocean and coastal upwelling regions). We hope that our work will inform many different groups of researchers. For example: Our work on nitrogen isotopes in the Southern Ocean aims to inform the interpretation of paleo proxies on the strength of the biological carbon pump during glacial and interglacial cycles. Our work on N2 fixing organisms will inform biogeochemical modelers on current and projected future productivity of our oceans. The work on marine productivity will inform ecologists, physiologists and numerical modelers on processes affecting the base of the marine food web. We further hope that our work on the toxic dinoflaggelate Karenia brevis, a Gulf of Mexico red tide organism, will inform decision makers and ecosystem managers to better understand and predict the socio-economic impact of this organism in the current and future ocean.

Synthesis of host DNA, RNA, and protein is shut off, presumably to prevent those syntheses from competing with the corresponding phage biosyntheses for materials, energy, and access to biosynthetic machinery. Such global redirection of the cell's resources requires regulatory mechanisms of great sophistication and specificity, to eliminate the host-specific biosyntheses, while exactly the same processes, specific to the phage genome, proceed with enormous efficiency in the same cell. We are analyzing the mechanisms by which SPO1 accomplishes this takeover of the host cell. We have identified a cluster of 24 genes in the terminal redundancy of SPO1, which specifies most or all of the necessary machinery. By observing the effect of expression of each gene in uninfected cells, and the effect of mutational inactivation of each gene on the progress of infection, we are defining the specific roles of the 24 gene products. Activities that have been identified for specific gene products include: (1) shutoff of host DNA and RNA synthesis; (2) regulation of the timing of those shutoffs; (3) inhibition of host cell division; and (4) regulation of expression of the 24 genes. The broad spectrum bactericidal activity of some of these gene products makes them a potential basis for development of new antibiotics.",http://www.bioc.rice.edu/~crs/index.html
