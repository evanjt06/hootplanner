We are specifically interested in how different phytoplankton groups respond to environmental perturbations such as changes in CO2, light intensity and nutrient availability. My students and I aim to not only characterize the responses of phytoplankton to a multitude of environmental factors, but also to understand the underlying processes of the measured responses, such as photosynthetic pathways, carbon acquisition processes and protein regulation. In collaboration with my colleagues at FSU, within the US and around the globe, we investigate these ecophysiological responses on different levels (from gene expression to ecosystem function) and in many ecosystems (Gulf of Mexico, tropical oligotrophic regions, Southern Ocean and coastal upwelling regions). We hope that our work will inform many different groups of researchers. For example: Our work on nitrogen isotopes in the Southern Ocean aims to inform the interpretation of paleo proxies on the strength of the biological carbon pump during glacial and interglacial cycles. Our work on N2 fixing organisms will inform biogeochemical modelers on current and projected future productivity of our oceans. The work on marine productivity will inform ecologists, physiologists and numerical modelers on processes affecting the base of the marine food web. We further hope that our work on the toxic dinoflaggelate Karenia brevis, a Gulf of Mexico red tide organism, will inform decision makers and ecosystem managers to better understand and predict the socio-economic impact of this organism in the current and future ocean.

We are now in the post-genomic era where creative use of this information in a more synthetic context can be applied to exploration of new scientific horizons and practical construction of microbes with optimized functions through metabolic engineering. The broader relevance of our work fits with several larger societal themes that are apt to continue to be of importance: concerns about environmental pollution, concerns about future energy and chemicals in an age of more expensive petroleum, the increasing capacity of computation to address complex issues in biology, and trends toward miniaturization, efficiency, specificity in process industry. These ideas coupled with the desire to understand more complex biological processes and apply advances to health make microbial biotechnology an important component of biofuels, genetics, and synthetic biology research. Information regarding our work on metabolic engineering projects with the bacteria Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum related to formation and analysis of metabolic networks for specific chemical production and biodegradation is presented on this website. Other projects concerning how the pattern of cell-to-cell distribution of particular proteins can affect cell adaptation under fluctuating conditions and efforts to develop novel chemical and genetic manipulation tools are also ongoing.",
